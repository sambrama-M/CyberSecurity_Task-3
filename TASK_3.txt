 OpenVAS Vulnerability Scan Summary (Host: 192.168.1.109)

  Scan Details:

* Scan Date: June 27, 2025
* Total Vulnerabilities Detected:

  * High severity: 18
  * Medium severity: 36
  * Low severity: 3


--> High Severity Issues:

1. The TWiki platform is vulnerable to cross-site scripting and command execution, allowing attackers to run arbitrary code.
2. The system runs an outdated Ubuntu 8.04 operating system that has reached its end of life and no longer receives security updates.
3. Distributed Ruby (dRuby) service is misconfigured, enabling remote command execution.
4. The Java RMI server is insecurely configured, allowing unauthenticated remote code execution.
5. A potential backdoor is detected on port 1524 (Ingreslock).
6. MySQL allows root login with no password, making it highly vulnerable to unauthorized access.
7. PostgreSQL is accessible using default credentials (`postgres:postgres`).
8. VNC service accepts weak or default passwords, making it easy to brute-force access.
9. SSH service permits logins using default credentials like `msfadmin:msfadmin`.
10. vsftpd service contains a known backdoor vulnerability.
11. The phpinfo page is exposed, which leaks detailed configuration and system information.
12. Tiki Wiki CMS is affected by multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in its older version.
13. PHP-CGI setup allows attackers to exploit query strings to disclose source code or execute commands.
14. UnrealIRCd server is affected by a known backdoor that enables command execution.
15. HTTP PUT and DELETE methods are enabled, which could allow unauthorized file uploads or deletions.
16. rlogin service is active and unencrypted, exposing the system to passwordless logins.
17. Multiple services are running on vulnerable or unencrypted ports.
18. Backdoors and weak services are present on several high-risk ports (e.g., 21, 80, 1099, 8787).



--> Medium Severity Issues:

1. Anonymous FTP access is enabled, potentially exposing sensitive files.
2. Several expired SSL/TLS certificates were found on the system.
3. Use of outdated SSL/TLS protocols (SSLv2, SSLv3) and weak cipher suites.
4. Cleartext data transmission detected over Telnet, FTP, and VNC services.
5. Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) and XSS vulnerabilities exist in TWiki.
6. Samba service is vulnerable to remote shell command execution.
7. Tiki Wiki CMS has a SQL injection vulnerability in a specific module.
8. The `/doc` directory on the web server is openly browsable, exposing application details.
9. HTTP TRACE method is enabled, which could assist cross-site tracing attacks.
10. UnrealIRCd service allows authentication spoofing using certificate manipulation.


--> Low Severity Issues:

1. Weak MAC algorithms are supported in SSH.
2. TCP timestamps are enabled, which may assist fingerprinting.
3. Minor XSS vulnerability in Tiki Wiki CMS.



--> Recommendations:

* Update all outdated and vulnerable software and services.
* Replace the deprecated operating system with a supported version.
* Enforce strong and unique passwords across all services.
* Remove or secure unnecessary services like rlogin, Telnet, anonymous FTP.
* Disable unsafe HTTP methods such as PUT, DELETE, and TRACE.
* Reissue valid SSL/TLS certificates and configure secure cipher suites.
* Regularly audit and monitor services exposed to the network.
